First Lighthouse Audit from command line
First we start with a simple Lighthouse report to get into it.
For to run a basic report, enter the following command:

lighthouse "URL"

EXAMPLE: lighthouse https://www.medium.com
After you pressed enter the chrome browser will pop up and starts with the report.
At the same time the command prompt will start listing what lighthouse is currently testing. When the report is done you’ll see a link to where the report has been saved. The Report is automatically saved as HTML.
Furthermore the listing gives much more detailed insight into the website.

## Advanced: Customizing Google Lighthouse Report

Fo finding more features Google Lighthouse has a help function. It shows you a list of all available configuration options.
To see the list insert the following command into the command prompt:

lighthouse --help

Underneath you’ll find the most useful options.
Please note that generally the flags don’t need to be in a specific order.

Output
You can choose between three different formats
* HTML (default)
* JSON
* CSV

lighthouse <URL> --output format

Example: lighthouse https://www.medium.com --output json 

It is also possible to save two or all report formats

Example: lighthouse https://www.medium.com --output json 
--output html --output csv


Output path and name
Save your customized report to a specific folder and rename it.
lighthouse <URL> --output-path <PATH><Name>

Rename example:
lighthouse https://www.medium.com --output-path ./test.html
Result: Save report as test.html.

Rename exaple:
lighthouse https://www.medium.com --output json --output-path ./test.json
Result: Save report as test.json.

Output path and name example:
lighthouse https://www.medium.com --output json --output-path "C:\Users\cgiezendanner\Desktop\test.json"
Result: Save report to the specific folder as test.json.

Headless, quiet and view
When you request a report, the Chrome browser will open, and the command line log each part of the process.

If you don’t want the Chrome browser pop-up you can use the following command:
lighthouse <URL> --chrome-flags=”--headless”
Example: lighthouse https://www.medium.com --chrome-flags=”--headless”

If you want the report to run silently you can use the following command:
lighthouse <URL> --quiet
Example: lighthouse https://www.medium.com --quiet

If you want headless and without log in command line:
lighthouse https://www.medium.com --quiet --chrome-flags=”--headless”

If you want to know your report has finshed you can add the following command:
lighthouse <URL> --chrome-flags=”--headless” --quiet --view

Example: lighthouse https://www.medium.com --chrome-flags=”--headless” --quiet --view
With the “view” flag mention, your report opens in a chrome window once after it has finished running.

Categories
It is also possible to choose which categories you want to report on.
Following categories are possible:
Performance
Accessibility
Best Practices
SEO
PWA

ligthhouse <URL> --only-categories=<category>
Example: lighthouse https://www.medium.com --only-categories=SEO

Example for multible categories:
lighthouse https://www.medium.com --only-categories=SEO --only-categories=performance

Multiple Website-Reports with Google Lighthouse
So let’s save time and do reports for multiple websites with running batches of Lighthouse Reports on the command line.
For the following steps create a folder for your Lighthouse Reports. After placing the two files below:
Text file with URLs
Create a text file with multiple URLs as shown below:
Image for postImage for post

Batch file
Create a batch-file with your favourite text editor. Paste the following code into it:
@For /F "UseBackQ Delims=" %%A In ("URL FROM YOUR TEXT-FILE"
) Do @LightHouse "%%A" --quiet --chrome-flags="--headless"
Please note that you can place as much flags as you want into the code. All flags, which you can see in the “lighthouse help” are working also with the batch file.

Example for more flags:
@For /F "UseBackQ Delims=" %%A In ("URL FROM YOUR TEXT-FILE"
) Do @LightHouse "%%A" --quiet --chrome-flags="--headless" --view ----output-path "C:\Users\cgiezendanner\Desktop\test.json" --only-categories=performance
Save the file as “.bat”. Now you should have a text and a batch file in your folder.
Image for postImage for post
Run the script
Go back to the command prompt and navigate to the folder where the two files were saved.
cd <Nav URL>
Example with folder:
cd C:\Users\cgiezendanner\Desktop\Lighthouse\dev
All you should need to do now is running the command below:
<name of batch-file>.bat
